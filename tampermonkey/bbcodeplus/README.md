# BBCode+
This adds new features to the BBCode parser. Parsing is done locally.

*While this is far from finished, I've decided to abandon this project, given for a fact PkmnQ made a better BBCode parser [here](https://gist.github.com/PkmnQ/d870707d75e0c63dd4da1cc6bded3509).*

*The chance of recovery of interest is low.*
